# Rust_Project
Learning resources for Rust programming.
# Introduction
Welcome to the Rust_Project repository!<br>
In this repository, I will be recording my progress, projects, and code samples as I explore Rust.<br>
It serves as a documentation of my learning process and a resource for others who are also interested in learning Rust.<br>
# Repository Structure
- /projects: This directory contains the various projects I have worked on while learning Rust. Each project has its own folder with a README providing details and instructions.
- /code_samples: Here, you will find code snippets and examples that I have written to understand and demonstrate specific Rust concepts and features.
Feel free to explore the different directories to see my learning journey unfold.

# Getting Started
If you are new to Rust or want to dive into specific projects or code samples, please refer to the README files in the respective directories. They will provide instructions on how to set up your environment, build, and run the code.

# Contributions
While this repository primarily serves as my personal learning record, I welcome contributions, suggestions, and feedback. If you come across any issues or have ideas to improve my projects or code samples, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request. Let's learn and grow together!
Happy coding and learning!
